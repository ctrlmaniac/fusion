# Icons

Rootscss doesn't supply default icons. You can use all icons you want such as:

- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io)

However, you can add some styles to icons with the class `.icon` which sets the font-size of the icon, if you are using web fonts icons.

There is `.icon-button` class which changes the cursor.
